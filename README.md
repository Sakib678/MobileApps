## IMPORTANT PLEASE READ AND MAKE NOTE

This repository will contain several Android Projects - but Android Studio **can** only contain a single project at a time. 
This will mean that to work correctly with this repository.

1. Clone in the first instance through the Command Window
2. Open project folders directly in Android Studio
3. It is recommended that git commands are entered via the terminal window - **do not initialise repositories in 
subfolders** as the top-level folder is managing commit history
4. It is intended that each Project is worked on as a separate branch - you will see these via Github or by doing a **git branch --all** 
command in the terminal window.
5. This means that you need to switch to the appropriate branch when working on a project. Please try your best to stick to these branches.

***Folder Explanation***

Each folder contains a starting Android Studio Project that has been initialised with the current version of **Ladybug (2024.2.1 Patch 2)**. 
Inside each folder is a README.md file that provides more information about the task. 

This repository consists of 8 projects that map to the Google Codelabs exercises. Completing each exercise fully will receive a 
maximum of 10 marks. This is broken down as:
- 2 marks (codelab exercise)
- 3 marks (extension)
- 3 marks (answer to supplied question)
- 2 marks (commits, commit messages and updated README)

The history (commit messages) should contain meaningful information pertaining to the commit.

The assignment brief lists the expected deadlines and breaks the exercises into <u>TWO SETS OF FOUR</u>.
